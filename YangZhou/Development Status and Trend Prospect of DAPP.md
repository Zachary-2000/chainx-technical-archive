# Development Status and Trend Prospect of DApp

## Preface

DApp (Decentralized Application) has existed since the emergence of P2P network. It is an application running on computer P2P network rather than a single computer. DApp exists in the Internet in a way that is not controlled by any single entity. Before the birth of blockchain technology, BitTorrent, PopcornTime, BitMessage and other similar applications running on P2P network all belong to DApp in a broad sense  (hereinafter refers to DApp running on blockchain network).

## Principle of DApp Technology

The concept of DApp in the blockchain world comes from Ethereum community. It refers to the application based on smart contract, that is, the application layer above the contract layer in the blockchain technology model. The goal of DApp is to have a friendly interface between smart contract and users, at the same time, the underlying layer uses application related blockchain technologies, such as Ethereum, IPFs, etc.

DApp can run on a centralized server that can interact with blockchain nodes, or on any blockchain peer node. Compared with the general web application running on an ordinary server, DApp needs to submit transactions to the blockchain and read important data from the blockchain rather than the centralized database.

## Difference Between DApp and Traditional App

DApp corresponds to App (centralized application). The difference between the two is that the data interaction of DApp is completed by the smart contract deployed on the blockchain, which has the attribute of decentralization, that is, DApp = front end + smart contract; The data interaction of App is completed by centralized or distributed servers.

## Development Status of DApp

### Data Overview

According to the data of Dapp.review, as of August 4, 2021, 6370 dapps have been included, of which about 358 are daily active, and 15946 smart contracts have been deployed in total; The daily active users are about 110249, and the daily transaction volume is about 107 million US dollars.

### Comparison Of Chains

The active users of Ethereum are around 5W, which is much higher than other chains.

The number of active DApps on Ethereum is 147, and the number of active DApps on TRON is 123, which is not much different from Ethereum.

Trade volume:

The daily trading volume of Ethereum is about 213 million US dollars, and the TRON is about 108 million US dollars.

It can be seen that Ethereum is still the most popular DApp development platform.

From the category of DAapp, transaction, finance and game are the three most popular types of DAapp, and the transaction volume is also the largest.

## Trend Prospect of DApp

Blockchain technology has given us a lot of imagination. Technologies based on consensus mechanism, smart contract and cross chain integration will bring us a broad blockchain world. DAapp based on blockchain technology redefines the economic distribution model. Although it is still in the development stage, its value will have great space for improvement. In the future, we may only need one DAapp to do many cooperation and transactions based on "trust" and "value".
